# # Task 4
# # Open a now Jupyterlab notebook and save the file as:
# # TASK4_<your_name>_<your_class>_<index_number>.ipynb

# # The task is to write a function remove_word(phrase) that removes
# # consecutive repeated words in a phrase. The program:
# # >> allows the user to input a phrase and convert to lower case [1]
# # >> converts the phrase into a list of words. 
# #     Do this without the help of the builtin
# #     strings function such as str.split() [3]
# # >> removes consecutive repeated words from the list [3]
# # >> converts the list back into a new phrase. 
# #      Do this without the help of the built-in
# #     string functions such as str.join() [2]
# # >> returns and displays the new phrase. [1]

# # Save your Jupyterlab notebook for Task 4.

# # Sample Output 1:
# # Enter a phrase: Im a big big girl in a big big world
# # New phrase: im a big girl in a big world

# # Sample Output 2:
# # Enter a phrase: Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry naega naega
# # New phrase: sorry naega
